# SHFFL->Shine->Repeat (Web Client)

  Super Smash Bros Melee is hard. In a game this technically demanding,
  staying sharp is crucial to staying competative, but the more 
  responsibilities I accrue, the less time I have to practice. Having
  dedicated, scheduled practice time is the solution to this, and the 20XX training
  mods are incredible for focusing on specific tequniques. This is where
  SHFFL->Shine->Repeat comes in. SSR provides a medium through which 
  character specific training routines can be created and shared by the
  smash community, which can then be run, hands-free, on any device you
  want. 

### Disclaimer: 

This is still under heavy development, and I'm developing the service
layer in parallel, so things change unexpectedly and drastically. If you
like the idea and want to contribute, drop me an email and we'll talk. I welcome
any and all criticism, advice, ideas, etc...I just wouldn't want you to
waste your time improving code that may be deprecated tomorrow.
