# SHFFL->Shine->Repeat (Web Client)

This is still under heavy development, and is not currently deployed.

### Disclaimer: 

Most of this has been developed as I learn Angular one piece at a time, with only 
some of the design having been considered before diving in. It is neither secure 
nor unit tested, and there is a very good chance I'll end up destroying it and 
starting the prod quality build from scratch.
