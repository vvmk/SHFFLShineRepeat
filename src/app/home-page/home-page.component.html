        Consider the problem. This is a problem you might not know you had.
        I can't tell you how many times this has also plagued me. I lie awake 
        some nights thinking of a solution and how best to monetize it. Perhaps
        gathering metrics or writing an algorithm. Also here are some quotes
        by smart people to convince you that you indeed have this problem too.

        This is where you are made aware of just how difficult this problem is to 
        solve, and a good solution is not going to just appear unless someone does 
        something about it. You're beginning to realize that your life will never be complete.
        You will never truly be happy until an answer is found. Fret no more, comrade! Your
        savior has arrived...</p>
