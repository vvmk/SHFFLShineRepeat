        <p class="about">
        Super Smash Bros. Melee is hard. In a game so technically demanding, staying 
        sharp is crucial to staying competative. Unfortunately, practicing a hobby 
        (especially video games) tends to be one of the first victims claimed by the 
        onslaught of adult responsibility. But if something is important to you, you will 
        make time for it - as the saying goes.

        So you pick a chunk of time to practice every day. You get home from 
        work, load up 20XX, and set a timer for 30 minutes...but what to practice?
        Maybe just pillar/ken-combo a Fox CPU for the 10,000th time? Boring. "X minute 
        [character] practice routine" on YouTube? You'll spend more time playing with the video
        than your controller. Search SmashBoards? Write your own? Who's going to hold 
        the stopwatch? And how much of your 30 minutes did you spend setting up?
