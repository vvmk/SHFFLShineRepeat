                In a game so technically demanding, staying 
                sharp is crucial to staying competative. Unfortunately, practicing a hobby 
                (especially video games) tends to be one of the first victims claimed by the 
                onslaught of adult responsibility. But if something is important to you, you will 
                make time for it - as the saying goes.

                work, load up 20XX, and set a timer for 30 minutes...but what to practice?
                Maybe just pillar/ken-combo a Fox CPU for the 10,000th time? Boring. "X minute 
                [character] practice routine" on YouTube? You'll spend more time playing with the video
                than your controller. Search SmashBoards? Write your own? Who's going to hold 
                the stopwatch? And how much of your 30 minutes did you spend setting up?

                Pack made by Achilles1515. However if you really want to make the most of your practice time, 20XX is a must. 
                I defer any and all questions about 20XX to the link above. Also, If you like SSR and want to donate, I 
                would ask that instead you follow the link above and send the donation to Achilles1515. 20XX is a spectacular 
                piece of software without which I likely would not have been inspired to create SSR.</p>
