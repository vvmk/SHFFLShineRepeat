        Super Smash Bros. Melee is hard. In a game so technically demanding, staying 
        sharp is crucial to staying competative. Unfortunately, practicing a hobby 
        (especially video games) tends to be one of the first victims claimed by the 
        onslaught of adult responsibility.

        If something is important to you, you will make time for it - as the saying goes. True enough, 
        the answer is a compromise: Pick a satisfying but reasonable chunk of time and make that your
        dedicated practice time. Try to make it the same time every day, you want to 
        form a habit. Even a negligable commitment of 20-40 minutes a day of pure focus on training
        is enough to see significant results. <br>

        Here is where we hit a snag. Now that we have the time all laid out and have pushed our responsibilities
        to the side for 30 minutes, what do we do? The 20XX Training Hack Pack is a spectacular mod and almost a prerequisite to 
        competitive melee these days, but the one area in which 20XX won't help is specifically <i>what</i> to train and <i>how</i>.

        Sure, there are plenty of "X minute [some character] practice routine" videos on YouTube or lists on SmashBoards.
        But have you ever tried to use one in the exact time that it promised? You spend more time playing with 
        YouTube video controls or scrolling a brower than holding a controller. You could 
        memorize the routine (how much of your 30 minutes will you have left after that?) or 
        have someone sit next to you with a stopwatch (my wife laughed at me when I asked).

        Also what happens when you outgrow the routine? Want to tweak it slightly? Want to create your own?
        How long do you search online before you just go back to combo-ing a Fox CPU for the 10,000th time?
        This is where SSR comes in. Create, Edit, Share and actually run Melee training routines from a tool built 
        and optimized specifically to do so.
